            Hello! I am an Ohio native, sports-enthusiast, and science nerd. I received my Bachelor's degree
            in Environmental Science at Ashland University. My initial aspirations were to become a meteorologist
            with a specific focus in climatology. I received my initial introduction into the coding world when I
            completed an internship with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The internship
            tasked me with evaluating rain sensors with lightning sensors for an entire calendar year, which required me to 
            learn the Fortran language to complete my study. I developed a hobby that summer as I became quite 
            intrigued with how I could tell a computer to process data and to produce graphs and images. I went on
            to learn C++ the next school year. Toward the end of my senior year, I realized that meteorology was not 
            for me and that I needed to do a little soul searching. I applied to a program called TEACH Charlotte toward
            the end of my senior year, and after a rigorous summer teaching program, I was hired as a Chemistry teacher
            at West Charlotte High School. I am now in my 4th year teaching, and teaching has provided so many valuable 
            experiences. I feel I have completed my soul searching, and I am ready to pursue the hobby I developed
            five years ago and turn it into a career! I am ready for the challenges and excitements that come with being
            a web developer.
        </p>

            I was born and raised in Ohio and I moved to Charlotte right after I graduated from college in June 2014.
            My Ohio roots run deep as I am die-hard Cleveland fan. It does not matter which sport. That means I get 
            the glories that the Cleveland Indians and Cleveland Cavaliers provide. It also unfortunately means I get 
            all the sorrows that the Cleveland Browns provide year-in and year-out. I can assure you that my head is
            filled with some of the most useless sport knowledge that you can think of. However, if you ever need an
            extra person for sports trivia then I am your man. I am willing to carry the team as well! In my free time,
            I enjoy playing video games and exploring numerous areas of Charlotte with my wife. My wife is by far my best
            friend; therefore, if you see me out in the community, you will likely see me with her. We love going to the 
            movies, breweries and wineries, and sporting events. So I know we just met and this is crazy, but my contact
            sheet is ready. So hire me, maybe?
